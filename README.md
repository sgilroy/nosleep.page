# NoSleep Demo Page

This is a demo of NoSleep, based on https://nosleep.page created by [Bradley Kemp](https://github.com/bradleyjkemp).

The page demonstrates two versions of NoSleep:

- The original [richtr/NoSleep.js](https://github.com/richtr/NoSleep.js)
- A fork [no-sleep](https://github.com/zakj/no-sleep) by [Zak Johnson](https://github.com/zakj) to address the bug with the [Screen Wake Lock API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Wake_Lock_API) affecting standalone Home Screen Web Apps on iOS.

Unlike the original nosleep.page, this implementation includes a PWA (Progressive Web App) manifest to support testing as a standalone web app instead of just as a web page.
